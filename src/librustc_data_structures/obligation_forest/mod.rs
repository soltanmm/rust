//! The `ObligationForest` is a utility data structure used in trait
//! matching to track the set of outstanding obligations (those not
//! yet resolved to success or error). It also tracks the "backtrace"
//! of each pending obligation (why we are trying to figure this out
//! in the first place). See README.md for a general overview of how
//! to use this class.
